# Web-Based Facial Authentication System

## Overview

This project is a **real-time face detection and authentication system** using a webcam and OpenCV. It’s designed to work in a web-based interface powered by Flask, where users can view live video feed from their webcam and detect faces in real time. This system has a variety of potential applications, such as in **user authentication** for online meetings, **exam proctoring**, or **security systems**.

## Features

- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Detects faces using OpenCV’s Haar Cascade classifier.
- **Web-Based Interface**: The video feed is accessible in a web browser, making it platform-independent.
- **Expandable for Authentication**: Can be extended with advanced face recognition for user-specific authentication.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend programming language.
- **Flask**: Micro web framework for serving the application.
- **OpenCV**: Library for computer vision tasks, used here for face detection.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend for rendering the video feed.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-based-facial-authentication.git
   cd web-based-facial-authentication
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Use `pip` to install the required libraries.

   ```bash
   pip install flask opencv-python
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:

   Start the Flask server by running:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Open the Application in a Browser**:

   Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser to access the web-based face detection system.

- **app.py**: Flask application that handles video streaming and face detection.
- **index.html**: HTML template for displaying the live video feed.

## Usage

1. **Open the Web App**: After starting the server, open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser.
2. **Face Detection**: The app will access your webcam, and you’ll see a live video feed with rectangles drawn around detected faces.

## Future Enhancements

This project is a foundation for building a more complex facial authentication system. Here are some potential enhancements:

- **Face Recognition**: Use models like dlib or FaceNet to authenticate specific users.
- **Alert System**: Notify users if unrecognized faces are detected.
- **User Management**: Allow adding and managing user profiles for individual authentication.
